Readme file for documentation of Exploritory Data Analysis

1.Objectives of EDA
  1. Understand the structure and quality of the data.
  2. Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values.
  3. Explore relationships between variables.
  4. Extract meaningful patterns and insights.

2.Steps in the EDA Process

   1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
  - Loaded the dataset into the analysis environment.
  - Displayed the first few rows using tools like `head()` to understand data structure.
  
   2. Data Cleaning
  - Missing values: [Describe approach, e.g., removed rows/columns, imputation methods used].
  - Duplicates: [State whether duplicates were found and actions taken].
  - Data type corrections: [Mention any conversions performed].

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
- **Summary**:
  - Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., for numerical columns.
  - Frequency distribution for categorical columns.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Tools Used**: [e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly]
- **Plots Created**:
  - Histograms to analyze distribution of numerical data.
  - Boxplots to identify outliers.
  - Scatter plots for relationships between variables.
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

### 5. Key Insights
- [List the main findings from your analysis, e.g., "Athletes from country X have the highest average medals."]

## Challenges and Resolutions
- **Challenge**: [Describe challenges, e.g., "Dataset contained many missing values."]
  - **Resolution**: [Describe how challenges were addressed, e.g., "Imputed missing values with median."]

---

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - [Any other libraries]

## Next Steps
1. Perform feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. Use advanced statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms to extract deeper insights.

---

## Conclusion
The EDA revealed [summarize main findings briefly, e.g., "a strong correlation between training hours and medal count"]. The cleaned and analyzed data is now ready for further modeling and predictive analysis.
